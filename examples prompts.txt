Prompt 1 - Fitness Center Ambiance

A high-resolution, cinematic photograph of a modern, well-lit gym interior. The focus is on the free-weight area. The lighting is dramatic, with strong, focused overhead spotlights highlighting the chrome and black finishes of the equipment. A small amount of diffused sunlight streams through large, industrial windows, catching dust motes in the air. The atmosphere is intense and motivating, with a sleek, minimalist aesthetic. Include elements like organized dumbbells, a weight rack, and a rubberized floor. The brand name "Iron Strength Fitness" is subtly visible on a wall banner or piece of equipment, alongside the slogan "Unleash Your Inner Power". A small, elegant sign or a digital display shows the phone number: (91) 9 9999-9999 and the address: Rua da Força, 123 - Centro, Cidade Fitness.

Prompt 2 - Café (Coffee Shop)

A warm, inviting, and detailed interior shot of a bustling yet cozy coffee shop. The shot is taken from a slightly elevated angle looking over a wooden table. The focus is on a perfectly crafted latte with rich foam art and a freshly baked croissant on a small plate. In the blurred background, we see soft, natural light filtering in, comfortable seating (like leather armchairs or velvet banquettes), and a barista preparing a drink at the counter. The color palette is composed of warm browns, deep greens, and creamy whites. The café name, "Aroma & Grãos," is elegantly displayed on a small chalkboard menu in the distance, accompanied by the slogan "Sua Pausa Perfeita, Nosso Café". A discrete sign or menu insert shows the phone number: (91) 9 9999-9999 and the address: Avenida do Sabor, 456 - Bairro Café, Cidade Deliciosa.

Prompt 3 - Pet Shop (Pet Store)

A bright, colorful, and fun illustration of a curated display shelf inside a high-end pet shop. The products are neatly stacked, featuring quirky packaging designs for various pet supplies (toys, gourmet treats, and collars). The scene includes an adorable Golden Retriever puppy sitting patiently next to the display, looking up with playful eyes. The overall mood is cheerful and friendly. Use a vibrant, slightly pastel color scheme. The pet shop's name, "Amigo Fiel Pet Boutique," is prominently featured on a stylish wall sign above the shelf, with the slogan "Tudo para o Seu Melhor Amigo". A small, cute paw-print shaped sign displays the phone number: (91) 9 9999-9999 and the address: Rua dos Bichinhos, 789 - Parque dos Pets, Cidade Amor Animal.
